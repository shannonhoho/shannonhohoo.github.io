			<h2>Analysis of Angel Beats</h2>
    		<p>For this post, I decided to write about one of my all-time favorite anime series. Ever. Angel Beats.</p>
            <p>WARNING THIS POST WILL CONTAIN MAJOR SPOILERS!</p>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>The story of Angel Beats revolves around a group of high schoolers who attend a school… but… they are all dead. Every “student” there is a teenager or young person who has passed away in real life. The school is acting as a type of afterlife or purgatory. The students don’t really understand why they are there, including the main character Otonashi. They are aware that they are dead, though.</p>
            <img src="https://venue-blog-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Angels-Beats-Cast-Photo-1024x576.jpg" alt="cast" width="1200">
            <p>Many of them have different reactions to being in the afterlife. Some are confused. Some are complacent. Some are angry, like Yurippe, who decides she is going to fight against God because she believes that he is cruel and unjust. However, all of the students have one thing in common.</p>
            <p>They had a tragic life. They all died while they were still young, all with unfulfilled dreams and wishes. As the story goes on, the purpose of the afterlife school becomes obvious: it’s to help the characters gain closure. For them to relive a small portion of their lost dream, even if it isn’t quite what they imagined. They realize that if they move on from this place, they will be able to try to achieve their dream again in a different time and form, in a different, new life.</p>
            <h3>IWASAWA: HOPE THROUGH MUSIC</h3>
            <p>Iwasawa is an aloof rocker girl that doesn’t care much about anything but her music. We find out that in real life, her home environment was unstable. Her father was constantly drinking and getting into fights with her mother, to the point where it was abusive. Lost and confused, Iwasawa eventually found an escape through music. It was the only thing that gave her hope. She came to love music so much that she decided to make it her career. She planned on becoming a successful singer, so she could make enough money to move out of her dysfunctional home.</p>
            <img src="https://thumbs.gfycat.com/GivingFaroffBluegill-size_restricted.gif" alt="iwasawagif" width="1200">
            <p>But her dream ended too early, cut off by the very thing that inspired it in the beginning. In a drunken rage, Iwasawa’s father hits her with a glass bottle, causing brain damage. She died shortly after in the hospital.</p>
            <p>Iwasawa took her love of music into the afterlife. She started a band and continued to play rock music. (The band is called Girls Dead Monster, and you can actually listen to her their music.) At one point, she and the band are able to play on the school stage in front of an audience. Although it isn’t some grandiose rock show in an arena, Iwasawa still enjoyed herself. At that moment, she was able to bring the joy of music to others. For just a small period of time, even if it was just a couple seconds, she was able to fulfill her dream.</p>
            <h3>YUI: EXPERIENCING LIFE FOR THE FIRST TIME</h3>
            <p>She is extremely energetic and hyperactive, with a love of music. Not to mention, she has pink hair and an adorable design.Despite her exuberance in purgatory, Yui wasn’t so active in real life. In fact, she wasn’t active at all.</p>
            <p>At a young age, she was almost completely paralyzed. To the point where she had to stay in bed all day. I imagine that most people in that situation… whatever dream they had beforehand… would probably evaporate. What dream can be fulfilled if you can barely move? Maybe if it is something intellectual… but unless there is some kind of miracle, if your dream was, for example, to be a basketball player that dream would most likely not come true.</p>
            <img src="https://thumbs.gfycat.com/EqualPhysicalHoneyeater-size_restricted.gif" alt="bedridden" width="1200">
            <p>In Yui’s case, she was paralyzed at a young age. She didn’t have a concrete dream back then, so it wasn’t like her lifelong dreams were suddenly shattered. But sitting in her bed, unable to do anything except for watching TV, Yui began to have dreams. She wanted to do all of the things she saw on television, things she was unable to do in her everyday life.</p>
            <img src="https://coubsecure-s.akamaihd.net/get/b87/p/coub/simple/cw_timeline_pic/d94a5b28e92/13323268f59ab5fd6640f/big_1471490792_image.jpg" alt="couple" width="1200">
            <p>Perhaps the reason that Yui is so hyper is because she was finally able to move freely once she entered the afterlife. No longer confined, she is able to use all of her energy (and dang, does she have a lot). Even with this, however, Yui still wants to do the amazing things she saw on television. Otonashi decides to help her, and they go on a crazy adventure, doing random things. One of the funniest and most memorable moments is when Yui wants to practice doing a wrestling move. Otonashi helps her with all of this, but there is still one last dream she has, one that Otonashi isn’t sure she will be able to fulfill. Yui wants to be a bride. When he hears this, Hinata (my favorite male character) steps in and says he will marry her. Of course, they can’t really get married. But just the thought makes Yui so happy that she is able to move on, all her pent up wishes finally realized.</p>

			<h2>Analysis of Chuunibyou</h2>	
    		<p>For this post, I am going to take a slightly different approach and analyze my favorite anime of all time: Love, Chuunibyou, And Other Delusions (Chuunibyou Demo Koi Ga Shitai) on the topic of delusions.</p>
            <p>WARNING THIS POST WILL CONTAIN MAJOR SPOILERS!</p>
            <h3>WHAT DOES CHUUNIBYOU MEAN?</h3>
            <p>“Chuunibyou” is a Japanese slang term that translates to something like: “middle school syndrome” or “eighth grader disease.” It refers to when children hit puberty and start to experiment with their identity. In many cases, these preteens and teens do strange things that don’t make sense to others or adults. I am a perfect example. In the beginning of high school, I was completely obsessed with the album Black Parade by My Chemical Romance. I constantly wrote their merchandise, wrote their lyrics on my arms, wore all black and had all black belongings, and frequently cosplayed as the band members. It may have seemed weird to others, but it was an important part of my identity and helped me cope with my anxiety and depression as I went through high school.</p>
            <h3>LOVE, CHUUNIBYOU, AND SANCTUARY</h3>
            <p>Love, Chuunibyou, and Other Delusions is an anime that is entirely focused on characters who are chuunibyou. In the series, Yuuta, the main male protagonist, becomes friends with a girl named Takanashi Rikka, who is 100% chuunibyou.</p>
            <p>Every day she wears an eyepatch on her eye and a bandage on her wrist, which apparently seals away a demon that is sleeping inside of her. Rikka is unable to have a normal conversation- everything that comes out of her mouth is about magic, spells, weapons, the spirit world, and so on. She also frequently does odd things, such as pretending to have battles in public, which, from an outsider’s point of view, just look like her flailing around nonsensically.</p>
            <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3qbp_mt-qFk/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="rikka" width="1200">
            <p>The other characters in the show have chuunibyou tendencies as well. Yuuta has a chuunibyou past where he believed he had the power to control flames of darkness. Nibutani thought she was a 500-year old sorceress who could communicate with fairies. Dekomori pretends her pigtails are the hammer of Thor, and goes around smacking people with her hair (Favorite. Character. Ever.).</p>
            <h3>RIKKA’S ESCAPE (SPOILER TIME)</h3>
            <p>At first, Yuuta assumed that Rikka was acting chuunibyou because she thought it was cool. However, when they go on a summer trip, Yuuta finds out about Rikka’s past. It turns out that two years earlier, Rikka’s father died unexpectedly. Rikka was not aware that he had been sick and she took his death very hard.</p>
            <p>After her father’s death, she was very confused and depressed. Then, she discovered chuunibyou. By immersing herself in a fantasy world, Rikka became able to cope with her father’s death. She used her chuunibyou persona to search for the “invisible boundary lines”- the line between this world and the spirit world. In doing so, she felt as though she was searching for her father’s spirit and that she might be able to reunite with him one day.</p>
            <img src="https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/857228555079173919/8A2162CAB528727D855C8915613B1BA042FDD731/?imw=500&imh=267&ima=fit&impolicy=Letterbox&imcolor=%23000000&letterbox=true" alt="rikkagif" width="1200">
            <p>In this sense, Rikka’s chuunibyou delusions are her sanctuary. When she is in her fantasy world, she feels safe and secure. Chuunibyou Rikka has a goal and a purpose- she is confident in her abilities. Meanwhile, normal Rikka is scared, confused, and lonely. She is unsure of what the future will bring, and she doesn’t want to be in a world where her father will never come back.</p>

			<h2>Best Anime of the Decade</h2>	
    		<p>Every year we're treated to a swath of <em>great</em> anime series; from shoujo that pull at heartstrings, to intense shonen staples that always promise excellent action, there are so many different kinds of anime to look forward to. In the past decade, we've seen anime continue through its moe phase and bring forth tons of new isekai.</p>
            <p>This list is not ranked but is organized by an anime's release year. We opted to list only the first season of each show with few exceptions in order to highlight more anime from the last ten years.</p>
            <h2>2010</h2>
            <h3>Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt</h3>
            <img src="https://d1m6vmmwsgiy3l.cloudfront.net/wallpapers/panty-stocking-with-garte_769_1680.png" alt="top10" width="1200">
            <p>Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt is GAINAX’S take on Western cartoons like The Power Puff Girls and Invader Zim with an incredibly obscene, crude twist. The Anarchy Sisters, Panty and Stocking, are angels working with priest Garterbelt to earn their way back into heaven by fighting off ghosts - however, these “angels” are anything but morally inclined heroes. They curse in nearly every sentence and don’t give a damn about much of anything other than their vices: sex and sweets. It’s an irreverent, entertaining joy-ride with dozens of tributes to western cartoons and a bangin’ soundtrack. Just don’t watch it around any children.</p>
            <h2>2011</h2>
            <h3>Chihayafuru</h3>
            <img src="https://wallpapercave.com/wp/wp3929794.jpg" alt="top11" width="1200">
            <p>Anime features all sorts of clubs and the drama that ensues, but few feature bonds formed so strongly through a game like Chihayafuru. Karuta is a competitive card game that requires its participants to learn 100 poems and snatch away cards that feature the second verse of a poem when the first verse is read aloud. This seemingly simple game brings together three children who dream of becoming the best karuta players in Japan. However, they separate in middle school and their bond through karuta is tested when they find each other again in high school. Chihayafuru is as much a sports anime as it is a drama, and its engaging characters and their personal growth are wonderful.</p>
            <h2>2012</h2>
            <h3>Psycho-Pass</h3>
            <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/71/18/e1/7118e1cf8ba3b9c246c334c57b637675.jpg" alt="top12" width="1200">
            <p>With notable influence from films like Minority Report and Blade Runner, Psycho-Pass is a cyberpunk crime drama set in a near dystopian--or utopian, depending on perspective--future Japan. The enigmatic Sybil System keeps society running crime-free, constantly evaluating all citizens’ “Psycho Passes,” to determine if their mental state deteriorates to the point of becoming a “latent criminal.” If they are, they are proactively detained or dispatched. A psychological thriller with multiple layers of mystery, Psycho-Pass kept us on our toes through the entirety of the first season.</p>
            <h2>2013</h2>
            <h3>Kill la Kill</h3>
            <img src="https://wallpapercave.com/wp/wp3821285.jpg" alt="top13" width="1200">
            <p>Kill la Kill's unique style and animation are an energetic delight, and the story that goes with them is just as eclectic and cool. Protagonist Ryuko Matoi is looking for the other half of a massive scissor blade that's owned by whoever murdered her father, and the local class president of her new school is the prime suspect. Much like Kill la Kill director's other works, the conflict between the girls in super-powered sailor suits is merely just a starting point for their adventure. Kill la Kill's unabashed fan service and certain uncomfortable scenes can make it a tough one to recommend, but it's one hell of an exciting ride at its heart.</p>
            <h2>2014</h2>
            <h3>Parasyte: The Maxim</h3>
            <img src="https://wallpapercave.com/wp/wp1975820.png" alt="top14" width="1200">
            <p>The first few moments of Parasyte: The Maxim warn viewers of what they’re in for: Gory, creepy, sci-fi body horror. One night, spores of unknown origin appear worldwide, producing worm-like creatures that inhabit humans and animals and turn them into emotionless, cannibalistic predators. While sleeping, 17-year-old Shinichi is nearly taken over, but the “parasyte” fails to consume his brain and resigns to taking over his right hand. Together, they must learn to co-exist and face the coming horror of the parasite’s potential worldwide domination while answering the question: What is it to be human?</p>

            <h3>Death Parade</h3>
            <img src="https://images6.alphacoders.com/676/thumb-1920-676633.png" alt="top15" width="1200">
            <p>Short and bittersweet, each episode of Death Parade explores the life of recently deceased people as they play an arduous game with devious twists in order for their soul to be judged. One particular Arbiter, Decim, begins to subtly question the validity of the system after meeting a peculiar young woman who is unable to recall her past. Part overarching mystery, part episodic judgment of the week, Death Parade is an interesting look into human nature with plenty of twists along the way.</p>
            <h2>2016</h2>
            <h3>Mob Psycho 100</h3>

            <p>There's not much that stands out about Shigeo "Mob" Kageyama, at least not until he loses control of his emotions and becomes an insanely out-of-control psychic. But when that's not happening, he's learning to improve himself with the help of his family and scam-artist mentor, Reigen Arataka. The two of them along with other excellent cast members find themselves in insane psychic fights with cults and other mischievous characters. Mob Psycho 100 is the whole package; it's got incredibly animated action, a heartfelt story, and wonderful characters and absolutely deserves to be on any watchlist.</p>
            <h2>2017</h2>
            <h3>Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid</h3>
            <img src="https://images7.alphacoders.com/817/817794.jpg" alt="top17" width="1200">
            <p>What happens when your average office-worker gets drunk, wanders into the woods, and accidentally saves a dragon? The dragon offers to be her maid! Miss Kobayashi’s Dragon Maid is about the hard-working Kobayashi, the dragon maid Tohru, and the other colorful dragons and friends they bring into their hearts along the way. A heartfelt dramedy with family at its center, it serves a nice reminder that even people as powerful as dragons have doubts and insecurities, and sometimes need the helping hand of friends or family to get through it.</p>
            <h2>2018</h2>
            <h3>That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime</h3>
            <img src="https://wallpaperaccess.com/full/1605734.jpg" alt="top18" width="1200">
            <p>Mikami Satoru used to be a regular old Japanese office worker… until he was murdered and reincarnated as a Slime with extraordinary abilities in another world. It’s pretty ripe with Isekai tropes, but That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime does it well, and even a bit differently. Part action-adventure, part politics, part harem (but not too over-the-top about it), with plenty of heartstring-tugging drama and fourth-wall-breaking humor to get you through it, That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime is a wholesome treat for fantasy lovers - especially if you’re a fan of JRPGs.</p>
            <h2>2019</h2>
            <h3>Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba</h3>
            <img src="https://c4.wallpaperflare.com/wallpaper/114/538/572/anime-demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba-genya-shinazugawa-giyuu-tomioka-inosuke-hashibira-hd-wallpaper-preview.jpg" alt="top19" width="1200">
            <p>Set in Japan during the Taisho period (early 1900s), Demon Slayer tells the story of Tanjiro, a young man set on revenge against a demon who massacred his family and left his younger sister Nezuko a demon herself. Against all odds, Tanjiro begins training as a “demon slayer” with Nezuko by his side. Tanjiro never loses his kindness and empathy throughout harrowing, beautifully animated battles, which breathes life into all characters - friendly or not. Demon Slayer’s most dramatic scenes merge all aspects - music, animation, story - into a beautiful symphony of emotional spectacle, and the grandeur simply never gets old.</p>

			<h2>Analysis of Clannad</h2>	
    		<p>For this post, I am going to write about one of my all time favorites: Clannad. I am going to focus on  the show’s main character Tomoya and his journey through both Clannad and Clannad After Story.</p>
            <p>WARNING THIS POST WILL CONTAIN MAJOR SPOILERS!</p>
            <h3>THE BEGINNING</h3>
            <p>Clannad follows the story of Tomoya, a high school “delinquent.” He doesn’t care about school or his future. Instead, he listlessly wanders through his life without a clear purpose. It isn’t that he doesn’t have one- it’s just that his former purpose was taken away from him. When he was younger, Tomoya was on the basketball team until he dislocated his shoulder. This injury made him  physically unable to raise his arms above his head, a must for shooting hoops.</p>
            <p>It was actually Tomoya’s father who ended his basketball career.  Tomoya’s mother had died several years earlier, leaving his father to raise him by himself. The stress and despair made him turn to alcohol and, in a drunken rage, he fought with Tomoya, causing the shoulder injury.</p>
            <p>In a short amount of time, Tomoya had lost his passion, his mother, and also his father, who became very distant after the accident.</p>
            <p>He continues his empty existence, drifting through each day.  That is, until he meets Nagisa. She is a shy and timid girl who has health issues. Because of this, she tends to rely on other people and isn’t able to do much on her own. However, she is kind and understanding.</p>
            <img src="https://animebubblecandy.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/clannad160811.jpg" alt="nagisa" width="1200">
            <p>One day, Tomoya randomly stumbles across Nagisa and he becomes interested in the strange yet unique girl. Nagisa wants to start up a Drama Club, but the previous club was disbanded because it did not have enough members. Tomoya decides to help her because he doesn’t have much else to do. He didn't know it at the time, but Nagisa would break up the monotony in his life.</p>
            <p>It is a moment that would literally change him forever.</p>
            <h3>FINDING PURPOSE IN THOSE AROUND YOU</h3>
            <p>At first, the Drama Club is mostly Nagisa and Tomoya figuring out how to restart it as an official club. Through their adventures, the two of them meet several other characters, such as Fuko, Kyou, Ryou, and Kotomi.</p>
            <p>Despite being jaded, Tomoya is actually a very kind person. He begins helping these different girls with their personal problems. And in becoming friends with them, Tomoya helps them with their own revivals. Fuko is able to attend her sister’s wedding… Kotomi gets closure about her parents. And as these girls experience a sense of rebirth, Tomoya experiences his own. He becomes closer to Nagisa and slowly begins to enjoy his life again. He looks forward to seeing Nagisa and being a part of the Drama Club.</p>
            <p>Although he still can’t play basketball or achieve some of the things he had hoped, he found a new purpose: Nagisa.</p>
            <p>The anime shows that sometimes it isn’t about material gains like wealth or status. Sometimes being able to help or be with a person you care about- whether it’s a friend, a family member, or a lover- is enough to make you feel whole.</p>
